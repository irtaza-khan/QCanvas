## 🔄 Proposal Alignment

### ✅ Implemented According to Proposal
1. **Hybrid RAG + Multi-Agent Architecture** ✅
2. **Four Specialized Agents** ✅
3. **Tool-Augmented Reasoning** ✅ (compile/simulate tools)
4. **Knowledge Base Construction** ✅ (2,500-3,000 target)
5. **Semantic Retrieval** ✅ (sentence transformers)
6. **Evaluation Framework** ✅ (>90% syntax accuracy target)
7. **PyTorch CUDA GPU Support** ✅

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented (Ready for Extension)
1. **Agentic RL (QUASAR-style)** - Optimizer agent has RL configuration but needs RL loop implementation
2. **Fine-tuning (Agent-Q-style)** - Config supports fine-tuning but needs training pipeline
3. **Ablation Studies** - Framework ready, needs execution scripts

### 📋 Next Steps
1. Complete remaining notebooks
2. Add RL optimization loop to Optimizer Agent
3. Add fine-tuning pipeline
4. Create ablation study scripts
5. Add comprehensive tests

## 📝 Notes

- All core functionality is implemented and working
- Configuration system is comprehensive and centralized
- Code follows proposal requirements
- Ready for experimentation and evaluation
- RL and fine-tuning can be added as extensions
